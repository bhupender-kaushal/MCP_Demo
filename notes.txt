Giraffes are the tallest living terrestrial animals, with males reaching heights of up to 18 feet (5.5 meters). They have distinctive spotted coat patterns, extremely long necks containing only seven vertebrae (the same number as humans), and can run at speeds up to 37 mph (60 km/h). Giraffes primarily eat leaves from acacia trees and have specialized adaptations including a 21-inch prehensile tongue and a unique cardiovascular system to manage blood pressure between their heart and brain.
GIRAFFES - ELABORATED INFORMATION:

Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are iconic African mammals and the tallest living terrestrial animals. They belong to the family Giraffidae alongside their closest relative, the okapi.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:
- Height: Males (bulls) reach 16-18 feet (5-5.5 meters); females (cows) reach 14-16 feet (4.3-4.9 meters)
- Weight: Bulls weigh 2,400-4,200 pounds (1,100-1,900 kg); cows weigh 1,600-2,600 pounds (720-1,180 kg)
- Neck: Contains only 7 vertebrae (same as humans) but each vertebra is elongated, measuring up to 10 inches long
- Legs: Front legs are slightly longer than hind legs, giving their backs a distinctive slope
- Tongue: Prehensile and bluish-purple in color, reaching 21 inches (53 cm) in length
- Coat: Unique spotted pattern that serves as camouflage and varies between subspecies
- Horns: Both sexes have "ossicones" - bony protrusions covered with skin and fur

ADAPTATIONS:
- Cardiovascular system: Specialized blood vessels and extremely powerful heart (weighing up to 24 pounds) to pump blood up the long neck
- Special adaptation called the "rete mirabile" prevents excessive blood flow to the brain when the giraffe lowers its head
- Thick, muscular tongue and tough lips to handle thorny acacia branches
- Excellent vision with panoramic viewing angles and enhanced color perception

BEHAVIOR:
- Diet: Herbivorous browsers, consuming up to 75 pounds (34 kg) of vegetation daily
- Social structure: Loose, fluid social groups with no permanent bonds except between mothers and calves
- Communication: Primarily through visual cues, infrasound (below human hearing range), and occasional vocalizations
- Sleep: Require only 30 minutes to 2 hours of sleep per day, often taken in short 5-minute intervals
- Defense: Powerful kicks capable of killing lions; adult giraffes have few natural predators

REPRODUCTION:
- Gestation: 15 months
- Birth: Calves are born while mother is standing, falling 5-6 feet to the ground
- Newborns: Stand within 30 minutes and are approximately 6 feet tall at birth
- Maturity: Sexual maturity reached at 3-5 years for females, 6-8 years for males

CONSERVATION:
- Conservation status: Vulnerable (IUCN Red List)
- Population has declined by approximately 40% over the last three decades
- Main threats include habitat loss, fragmentation, poaching, and civil unrest
- Currently recognized as four distinct species based on genetic studies (2016)
